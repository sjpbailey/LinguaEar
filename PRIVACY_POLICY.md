# BreathingBP Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the BreathingBP app ("the App") handles your information.  
BreathingBP is developed and published by Steven Bailey ("we", "us", or "our").

BreathingBP is a personal breathing and blood pressure companion app. It is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult your doctor about any health concerns.

## 1. Data We Collect

The App may access the following data *through Apple HealthKit* (if you grant permission):

- Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
- Heart rate
- Basic HealthKit metadata (such as timestamps)

The App does **not** create a user account and does **not** directly collect any other personal information.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

Health data read from Apple Health is used only to:

- Display your blood pressure and heart rate before and after breathing sessions
- Show simple history or trends inside the App
- Help you track your own wellness over time

We do **not** use your data for advertising, profiling, or tracking.

## 3. Data Storage and Sharing

- Your Health data is stored and managed by **Apple Health** on your device.
- The App may cache some values **locally on your device** to show recent information.
- **No health data is sent to our servers**, because we do not operate any backend server for this App.
- We do **not** sell or share your health data with third parties.

Apple may process data as described in Apple’s own privacy policy when you use HealthKit and iCloud.

## 4. HealthKit

The App uses Apple’s HealthKit framework. As required by Apple:

- The App only uses HealthKit data to provide features that are directly related to health and wellness.
- The App does not use HealthKit data for advertising or data mining.
- You can change Health permissions at any time in the iOS **Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices**.

If you revoke HealthKit permissions, some features of the App may no longer work.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

BreathingBP is intended for adults. It is not directed to children under the age of 13.  
If you believe a child has used the App and shared health data in violation of applicable law, please contact us (see Section 7).

## 6. Your Choices and Control

You can control your data in the following ways:

- **Health permissions**: Grant or revoke HealthKit access in iOS Settings.
- **Delete data from Health**: Open the Apple Health app to review and delete blood pressure or heart rate entries.
- **Delete the App**: Removing the App from your device deletes any data stored locally by the App.  
  (Data already stored in Apple Health must be managed from the Health app.)

## 7. Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or about how the App uses your data, you can contact:

- **Developer:** Steven Bailey  
- **Email:** sjpbailey1961@icloud.com

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will update the "Last updated" date above and may provide additional notice inside the App or on the App Store listing.
