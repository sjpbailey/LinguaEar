## PROJECT
- App: LinguaEar
- Platform: iOS + watchOS
- Repo: LinguaEar
- Primary Branch: main
- Active Dev Branch: Watch-V2

## CURRENT FOCUS
Version 2 — Practice Tutor (no embarrassment mode)

## LAST KNOWN GOOD STATE
- WelcomeView implemented and committed
- Watch-V2 branch clean
- Xcode user state ignored (.gitignore fixed)
- No uncommitted changes

## WHAT IS COMPLETE
- ✅ Version 1 released and frozen
- ✅ Watch-V2 branch created
- ✅ WelcomeView.swift updated
- ✅ Git hygiene fixed (xcuserstate ignored)
- ✅ Docs folder established

## WHAT IS IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Practice Tutor UI flow
- ⏳ Phrase grouping / practice logic
- ⏳ Decide whether practice lives in V2 only or shared with V1

## NEXT STEPS (DO NOT SKIP)
1. Review Practice Tutor screen layout
2. Decide final phrase grouping strategy
3. Implement PracticeSessionView
4. Add minimal test phrases (no embarrassment)

## HARD RULES
- Do NOT add new features unless explicitly decided
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT merge Watch-V2 into main yet
- Always update this file when stopping work

## LAST UPDATE
- Date: 2025-12-14
- By: Steven
- Reason: Stabilized repo + resumed V2 work
